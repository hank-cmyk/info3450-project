Semester-long project of Human-Computer Interaction Design course taken at Cornell university, displaying proficiency and understanding of all steps of user-centered design process. Final prototype design for an app that would enable individuals recovering from eating disorders to find healthy, consistent ways to independently maintain recovery and prevent relapse.

Includes:
- Use of Figma and all steps of user-centered design process, including but not limited to: user interviews, analysis of user pain points and needs, exploration of all potential solutions, wireframe sketches, low and high-fidelity UI sketches, polished and interactive final app design prototype, heuristic evaluation
- Understanding, analysis, and formalization of user needs, prototype creation, and evaluation of prototype usability
- HCI-semester: Folder containing all individual and group steps working on semester-long project for final protoype
- Polished Wireframe Sketch: Polished wireframe sketch for final prototype design, other wireframes and further explanation and background information found in A4 Group file
- Hi-fid UI Sketch: High-fidelity UI sketch for final prototype design, further explanations and background information found in A4 Group file
- Final Prototype Image: Final static image of interactive final prototype design, further explanations and background information, including link to interactive Figma file, found in A4 Group file
